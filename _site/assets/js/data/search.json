    "content": "2022-12-08Decided to change my career and get into IT. First thoughts. Feeling pretty lost and have no idea how. Researching.2022-12-09Got some books to start with. Also watching Youtube tutorials.my first books2022-12-10First “Hello world!”2022-12-12Found Sololearn app.2022-12-13Finished Tech For Everyone course. (everything seems easy)Started Python Core course. Excited.used my old google acc name2022-12-16Installed VSCode. Don’t understand anything but so interesting.2022-12-18Time to conquer Linux!Installed VM Ubuntu. Trying to connect VSCode…2022-12-23Still learning Python. love it.    apparently python core is not TEch for everyone. definitely not on few days2022-12-25Starting to hate it, but still pushing.    Merry Christmas, tho.2022-12-27With some help connected VSCode to Ubuntu on VirtualBox. Also connected Github.2022-12-31Happy New Year!2023-01-01Finally. It took me quite some time to finish, but I really tried to understand and use everything, not just read through and forget.(some topics got me. like OOP i had to go through few times each class and watch some extra tutorials online)2023-01-02Time to use new knowledge! Apparently just learning a language is not the hardest part. Still trying to figure out VSCode and Git. Getting better every day!2023-01-07Wrote my first Telegram Bot using PyTelegramBotAPI.Got an idea to deploy it on Google Cloud.2023-01-09Failing to deploy. Concerned.2023-01-11Realising that deploying as cloud function is a bit too hard for me, because PyTelegramBotAPI uses decorators and wrapping into a function isn’t that easy. Planning to rewrite using python-telegram-bot.2023-01-15With help deployed first bot as cloud VM instance. (Still planning to rewrite bot and deploy as cloud function.)Not very stable, but bot works.https://t.me/Sonia_friendly_catbot(it’s quite useless, but I’m not finished yet)2023-01-23Decided to create this Personal blog/website. Learning Jekyll and using it straight away.2023-01-28Finally deployed, website is running. Planning on updating and adding a few new posts in the future.Started learning API through Postman and Swagger.2023-02-07hmm… For some reason this one makes much more sense for me…(thinking)2023-02-21(well. at least this book is not for kids.)2023-03-06Okay. Lots of things have happened. I got my first Covid (ironic), Injured my A2 finger pulley while climbing, celebrated my 31 birthday and didn’t do much studies this month. I did watch some videos on Youtube (mostly on Computer Science) still trying to figure out which direction to move. But all this was not it. I realized that with this kind of learning I’ll end up wasting years… That’s why I made a plan… no-no. A Plan.(plan)2023-03-07I realized that free phone apps and Youtube videos are useful sometimes, but I need a properly structured and planned study plan and bought my first Udemy course. JavaScript course. Why JS. It just felt better than Python. Can’t explain it.2023-03-08Excited and optimistic start.2023-03-11It is actually quite fun.I decided not to just watch but actually try Everything from the course. Every piece of code I’m typing myself and doing everything to make it work. Also writing down most important parts into a notebook. Not that I might need it. Just to remember it better.some of the things are quite hard to wrap your head around…2023-03-16Pushing through.almost quarter done2023-04-27I know, I know. I haven’t written here for a while. I changed my location a bit. I’m in South East Asia at the moment. But I’ve been working hard since last time. Studying every day 2-3-4 hours. Learning a lot.more than half of this course is done.2023-05-25Okay, I’m back. It was a great time. And I did some progress as well. Almost there.already starting to plan a project to test what have I learnt2023-05-30Hooray, congrats to me! When I started this course almost 3 months ago I hoped to finish in 1-2 months. But it took almost 3 months…first and longest step done2023-05-31A quick review of the course. I liked it and it was really useful. The way everything was structured and built was perfect for comlete beginners or for someone who was switching from one language to another. Also I liked that author explained and taught a lot of small but useful things about running app, configuring IDE, deploying, testing, debugging. It wasn’t just JavaScript and nothing else. I really feal that this course if not just made me a good specialist but at least pushed in the right direction. Also I feel much much better about my knowledge now. I’m not as lost as I was half a year ago. But there are still lots of things to learn. So, lets move on. and next we have…2023-06-01My first project. I decided to do a static website with a map. I could think of a name so called it MaWe (Map and Weather). The idea is to get user’s location and show nearest public transport stops and where you can get from them. Also if the weather is rainy or cold or hot, this app should warn you and give some kind of advice. I beleive it might be quite useful for me and my parents since we’re not local here and if we’re okay with an area we live in, it still gets slightly harder in the parts of London we haven’t ever been too.thanks to Jonas ans his JS course for explaining the process and algorythm of building a project2023-06-17Done. It was not easy. It’s true that doing courses doesn’t teach you that much. Real learning starts when you start doing something with your own hands. But I managed to do it and im quite satisfied with the result.If you want to check it out welcome:maweapp.netlify.appAlso while doing this project I started another course. Preparing for coding interview. It’s not that I think im ready for applying for jobs, but it has some topics that I wanted to cover: Big O, Data Structures and Algorithms.2023-07-11It’s been a while. Lots of things have happened. Since I finished that project I still spent some time fixing bugs and refactoring whole app. Also I’ve worked for 3 weeks. Learning is great but it’s been a while since I worked, and my savings are running thin. (I’m so glad I was smart enough to save up quite a financial pillow and now I have this opportunity to use it for good.) Anyway because of work amount of time studying decreased significantly from 2-3-4 hours a day to 1-2 hours once a few days. But now I’m back and this little break was useful.2023-07-12Well, that’s not really me, but I’ve bought a bunch of courses on front-end, back-end, SQL, Linux, AWS, Clean Code, Network engineering etc. I know there are still a lot of things to learn and these courses kind of make sense to go through.Udemy what are you doing showing me all those discounts? xD2023-07-17I’ve decided. From what I’ve learnt so far, I can see that front-end isn’t really my thing I would really prefer doing more back-endish stuff. So today I started a new course: Node.js, Express, MongoDB and more. And I’m really excited to start!!! Yay!2023-08-13So, I’m almost halfway through. It been hard but I’m taking my time to understand everything. Also since this couse was recorded like in 2019 the technologies and libraries are slightly… erm… sometimes outdated, sometimes look differently, sometimes don’t exist enymore. And since I really try to make everything work and understand - it takes more time, but I’m pushing.P.S. also I will have a little break for 3 weeks. I will try to study, but can’t promise to study as much as now.2023-10-08Hello again. And Done!it took me a while, but it was worthyQuick review. I liked it. I don’t regret a second on deciding to learn back-end. The couse was much much much harder than JavaScript. Much more technologies, frameworks, libraries. A lot to learn and to understand. Authentication, Security, Authorization, Modelling data, rendering data, Error handling. huh. Now it’s time to start my biggest and most important project. Wish me luck!2023-10-10Few words aout my project. I plan to create a API for all documented losses in russo-Ukrainian War. There is a big OSINT project Oryx that documented all losses since the war started in February 2022, but all the information looks like a huuuge article with lots of links. And it’s quite hard to analyze. I want to scrape all that data, sort it and create a database, so it will be easier to read and analyze that data. probably I will create some simple dynamic website for it as well. So wish me luck and lets go!2023-10-17The hardest part was to start… There are so many things to do and I really took time to sort it all in my head and make at least a little plan what and how to do. Also i created name and logo. ahah. First step done. Welcome rUWDEL.please don’t mind my ugly handwriting2023-11-02I think I will go crazy with all this. I haven’t expected it to be this hard. But I’m not giving up, no. It’s been hard and frustrating before, and good thing I learnt is that doesn’t matter how hard it may seem to be, there is always a way to do it. And I’m quite adamant to finish this project.But I will probably to write anything here until it’s finished.2023-11-28Okay. I’m more than happy to announce that code part is done. There are still a couple of things to finish, like implement automatic update of databases and make website compatible with mobile devices and tablets, but in general it’s done. Api works, dynamic website works. Great. Now only to deploy it and ready.2023-12-01Okay. What seemed to be easy done became actually quite an interesting task. So my idea of deploying app to a cloud was pretty simple and straightforward. But after consulting with a friend who is a Senior DevOps, I realized that i was a bit naive. Real world deploying is a bit more complex. So now I need to research and learn couple of things first: https encryption, docker, nginx, cloudflare and a few more things.I cant really promise that i understand everything, but I will have get it anyway the sooner the better2023-12-05Well… I will not complain. But it is trickier than I expected. Anyway, I managed to get certificates for my domain, and configure nginx so that it works from my local machine… Some problems with configuring https though. Confusing.2023-12-07Okay I fixed small things that I needed to do before deploying. Still a bit stuck with deploying process. It’s frustrating, but I’m working on it.2023-12-10Deployed to cloud. Finally learned how to configure everything. Https works. Learnt a lot. It wasn’t easy at all. Last thing to do is to add cloudflare.2023-12-12HUUUH! Finally. My big and nice project is done. It’s deployed, works, updates automatically. Just nice and sound. I’m really happy. Learnt a lot about Docker and AWS EC2 instance.You’re welcome to come and see:rUWDEL.info2023-12-17For some reason decided to deploy my first MaWe microservice to the cloud too. Learnt even more about Docker, Nginx, and EC2.So now my previos project has a new adress:MaWe.live2023-12-21Finished another course that I’ve been watching last month or so. It was quite interesting and usefull. But I think I will need to rewatch it some day again. Too much information, not everything is crystal clear at this moment of my learning.I wonder how many of these useless certificates will I collect over the years xD"
