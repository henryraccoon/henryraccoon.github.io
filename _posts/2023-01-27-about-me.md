This is me. My name is Hennadiy Pohribnyy. I know ukrainian names are not the easiest to pronounce so you can call me Henry. 
I'm 30 years old and just recently moved to the UK. Trying to start a new life and new career. On this website you will be able to see my journey into IT and probably a bit more about me and my pesonality. Thank you c:
