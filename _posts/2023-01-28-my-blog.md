Happy New Year!

2023-01-01
Finally. It took me quite some time to finish, but I really tried to understand and use everything, not just read through and forget.

_(some topics got me. like OOP i had to go through few times each class and watch some extra tutorials online)_

Time to use new knowledge! Apparently just learning a language is not the hardest part. Still trying to figure out VSCode and Git. Getting better every day!

---

2023-01-07
Wrote my first Telegram Bot using PyTelegramBotAPI.
Got an idea to deploy it on Google Cloud.

---

2023-01-09
Failing to deploy. Concerned.

---

2023-01-11
Realising that deploying as cloud function is a bit too hard for me, because PyTelegramBotAPI uses decorators and wrapping into a function isn't that easy. Planning to rewrite using python-telegram-bot.

---

2023-01-15
With help deployed first bot as cloud VM instance. (Still planning to rewrite bot and deploy as cloud function.)
Not very stable, but bot works.

(it's quite useless, but I'm not finished yet)

---

2023-01-23
Decided to create this Personal blog/website. Learning Jekyll and using it straight away.

--- 

2023-01-28
Finally deployed, website is running. Planning on updating and adding a few new posts in the future.
Started learning API through Postman and Swagger.

---

To be continued...
